# Text-Analysis-Project-for-student-feedbackon-AI-driven-courses
Topic modelling analysis using NMF

A) Workflow for Analyzing Student Feedback (Synthetic → Insights)
Step 1: Data Generation / Collection

Since no real-world data is available, start with synthetic data simulation:

Use tools like Python’s faker, GPT-based generators, or manually design templates (positive, neutral, negative).

Fields to include:

student_id, age, gender, locality

course_name

feedback_text

rating (1–5)

suggestion

completion_status

would_recommend (Yes/No)

👉 This ensures the startup has a mock dataset to experiment with text analytics.

Step 2: Preprocessing the Feedback

Cleaning:

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters

Tokenization

Stopword removal

Lemmatization/Stemming

Example:
“The course was too fast and support was slow” →
["course", "fast", "support", "slow"]

Step 3: Text Representation

Use TF-IDF Vectorization to convert feedback text into numerical form.

Parameters:

ngram_range=(1,2) to capture phrases like “course content”.

min_df=2 to ignore very rare words.

Step 4: Topic Modelling

Apply NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) or LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

These extract hidden themes from feedback.

Example topics:

Content Quality → “course, practical, projects, realworld, useful”

Platform Issues → “technical, support, app, sessions, lag”

Mentorship/Support → “mentor, guidance, qna, helpful”

Pace & Structure → “fast, slow, advanced, coverage, detail”



📊 Interpretations & How Results Can Guide the Startup
1. Course Content

If many students talk about “projects, realworld, assignments” positively →
✅ Strength: Keep expanding practical content.

If negative mentions like “theory-heavy, outdated” →
🔧 Improve by adding more hands-on labs and case studies.

2. Platform/Technical Issues

If “lag, app, technical issues, support slow” dominate →
🔧 Startup should invest in platform stability and faster support response times.

3. Pace & Structure

If words like “fast, rushed, too basic” appear often →
🔧 Offer multiple difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced) or self-paced options.

4. Mentorship & Support

If students value “mentor, guidance, qna” →
✅ Strength: Emphasize mentor-driven learning in marketing.
🔧 If complaints exist, improve availability of doubt-clearing sessions.

5. Recommendations & Satisfaction

High proportion of “would recommend = Yes” → signals strong word-of-mouth growth potential.

If many “No” responses → investigate topics linked with negative sentiment.

🚀 Final Takeaways for Startup

Synthetic data lets the startup practice analytics before real data arrives.

Topic modelling + sentiment analysis uncovers what students talk about and how they feel.

Insights guide:

Course design → more projects, structured pacing, updated content.

Student satisfaction → fix platform bugs, improve mentorship, add flexible learning.

Business growth → highlight strengths (practical content, mentors) in promotions.
